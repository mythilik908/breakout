🚀 Breakout Game (JavaScript) 🎮

I created a simple and fun Breakout game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to break colored blocks using a paddle and ball. It includes features like multiple difficulty levels, score tracking, and a reset function. The game uses mouse movement for paddle control and has a responsive, interactive interface.

Key Highlights:
🎯 Interactive gameplay with paddle control.
🏆 Score and tries tracking system.
🔄 Difficulty levels ranging from 1 to 4 for varying challenges.
🎨 Stylish game elements with smooth animations.
